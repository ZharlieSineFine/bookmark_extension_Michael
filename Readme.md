# Bookmark save extension

I got tired of using the many extensions to save my bookmarks, so I decided to write a quick extension for Chrome.

Currently it is a very smiple and raw plugin, that just saves the current URLs from the open browser tabs in a JSON file.


Please feel free to use this code, and contribute to the project here.

The next features for this browser extension are:

- [ ] Firefox compatible extension
- [ ] Test and fix with Brave and Arch
- [ ] Safari extension
- [ ] Microsoft Edge extension
- [ ] Configure a folder to store all the bookmarks (to be setup by user in the extension display)
- [ ] Store a timestamp for each time the broswer tabs are saved
- [ ] Close all saved tabs
- [ ] Display page to load all the saved URLs from the saved file
- [ ] Optional object storage backup
- [ ] object storage access key and folder configuration in extension display page -admin
